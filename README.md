## Demo

Assistant is language and framework agnostic. Here is an example workspace configuration for Angular/TypeScript. It informs about a bad boolean Input declaration in Angular component. Normally it does not trigger build or linter errors and is a hard to track problem:

```
{
 ...
 "settings": {
  "assistant": {
   "rules": [
    {
     "regex": "@Input\\\\(\\\\) .*: false;",
     "message": "Define property value with =, not with:"
    }
   ]
  }
 },
 ...
}
```

# Assistant - Realtime Linter & Quality Assurance For Your Team

## How to add your own Assistant rules?

You can add rules to workspace settings file, and/or to user settings file depending on your needs.


1a. If you want to add settings to workspace, open Visual Studio Code Workspace:

a) If you don't have it, choose file "Save Workspace As..."
b) Press CTRL + ALT + P to open options
c) Find/write "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON) and open it


1b. If you want to add settings to user settings, open Visual Studio Code User settings:

b) Press CTRL + ALT + P to open options
c) Find/write "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) and open it


2. In the section settings add a item "assistant" and under it an item "rules" and under it an array of rules.

Each rule should contain:

regex - a string with a RegEx rule
message - text that should be displayed when the rule is trigerred

## How to add RegEx modifiers?

On default RegEx rules are processed with a 'g' modifier. You can change this behaviour. For example by adding an 'i' modifier to make the rule case insensitive. All RegEx modifiers are supported by the extension. How to add modifier?

1) Add a property "modifiers" to a rule and put there local modifier letters. For example: 'gi'.
2) Add a property "modifiers" on top of assistant JSON settings to set global modifiers for your rules

If both modifiers are set, local modifiers will be used.

## How to add multiline rule?

Set modifiers to "s"

3. Messages show up right above the code you write in miliseconds. You can immediately fix your code

### What is the difference between Assistant and regular Linters

1. Assistant is realtime. You don't need to wait for the linting process to finish. Assistant makes the coding process a much smoother experience
2. Messages show up above the code you write when you write it. You don't need to look into "Problems tab" and navigate back to the place where situation occurred. So you don't loose an eye off the code you write

### Notes for extension developers

- Use nvm 10.15.3
- If you face "Error: Failed to unzip downloaded vscode at", during npm run test go to ".vscode-test" folder and extract ZIP manually
- If you face "Running extension tests from the command line is currently only supported if no other instance of Code is running" close VSCode and run npm run test from command line / bash
