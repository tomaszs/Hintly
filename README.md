## ‚ú® Hinty - Intelligent Hints For Your Code In 1 Millisecond

Hinty lets you define intelligent hints that will display in your code in a matter of 1 millisecond. Works for every project

### You have to recalculate stuff in your mind back and forth? Add Hinty:

```
{
    "regex": "1rem",
    "message": "16px",
    "fileRegex": ".*\\.scss"
},
```

### Have to re-check documentation every time you use some API? Add Hinty:

```
{
    "regex": "flex-direction:",
    "message": "row - horizontal, column - vertical",
    "fileRegex": ".*\\.scss"
},
```

### You want to spot legacy code? Add Hinty:

```
{
    "regex": ":focus[^-]",
    "message": "Use focus-visible",
    "fileRegex": ".*\\.(css|scss)",
    "category": "css"
},
```

### You make same typos? Add Hinty:

```
    {
    "regex": "text-decoration: underscore;",
    "message": "It's underline",
    "fileRegex": ".*\\.scss"
    },
```

### Want your team to follow coding guidelines? Add Hinty:

```
{
    "regex": "ngClass",
    "message": "if conditional: change to class and [class.something]='something' if possible",
    "fileRegex": ".*\\.component\\.html",
    "category": "angular"
},
```

### And more!

The extension comes with 80 rules for web development for CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, Angular, and React and 8 rules for SQL.
Just copy them from rulesets folder.

You can also write your own rules. It's easy and fast.

Regex let's you build complex rules as well!

* Open Extensions
  * View -> Extensions, or:

## How to create a hint?

### 1. Choose the level for your hint:

#### User level Hintly

* Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to show command palette
* Write/find  "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) and click it

#### Workspace level Hintly

* If you don't have it, choose file "Save Workspace As..."

* Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to show command palette

* Write/find "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)" and click it

### 2. Add your first hint

Paste the code, so that the file looks like this:

```
{
    ...YOUR CONTENT...,
    assistant": {
        "rules": [
            {
                "regex": "hello Hinty",
                "message": "hello Developer :-)",
                "fileRegex": ".*\\.txt"
            },
        ]
    }
}
```

## Plain text instead of Regex

If you want to use a plain text instead of Regex, paste it here: https://www.regex-escape.com/online-regex-escaper.php. The page will escape Regex's special characters, so that you can use plain text without any effort.

for free for whatever you want, including commercial use

## FAQ

### Where I can read about how softwar engineers use the extension?

Please read an articles of rules authors. They covers ideas for rules and concept of how to write them:

### What's the difference between Hinty and AIs like ChatGPT or Copilot?

Hinty is like AI on steroids:

1. Gives you a hint in 1ms
2. You don't have to ask Hinty to help you
3. The hint is given precisely where you need it
4. Hinty doesn't lie
5. Hinty is 100% accurate every time

### What is the difference between Hinty and SonarLint?

1. You don't need to connect to a server to use Hinty making setup as easy as installing the extension
2. Writing rules is extremely easy with Hinty, so everyone can do it right away
3. Messages show up right above the code you write in miliseconds. You can immediately fix your code

### What is the difference between Hinty and regular Linters

1. Hinty is realtime. You don't need to wait for the linting process to finish. Hinty makes the coding process a much smoother experience
2. Messages show up above the code you write when you write it. You don't need to look into "Problems tab" and navigate back to the place where situation occurred. So you don't loose an eye off the code you write
3. Writing Hinty rules is extremely easy. Everyone can do it right away

## Notes for contributors (you probably don't need these)

### Installation
- If you face "Error: Failed to unzip downloaded vscode at", during npm run test go to ".vscode-test" folder and extract ZIP manually
- If you face "Running extension tests from the command line is currently only supported if no other instance of Code is running" close VSCode and run npm run test from command line / bash

### Publishing rules

1. Update README and CHANGELOG
2. Commit and push
